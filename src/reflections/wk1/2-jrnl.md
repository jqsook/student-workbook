# 1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

The focuse on a teir for deciding coloring. Primary, secondary, and tertiary. This seems logical from the outside but for me it showed the level of attention to detail this requires. All the tips were very benificial but not items I would have put thought into until I started this.

# 2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

Youtube is my first go to for help in design of an item. All the tutorials are written by other developers who have their own go to items so it will provide a greater array.
After that I would probably see what the mainstream UI's look like to decide if I could find a sutiable color pattern/scheme that I found pleasing to the eye.

# 3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Functionality is fine, but it seems that without a UI that is welcoming the user wont be engaged enough to want to use it. Its kind of like video game graphics- yeah I can play a sega, but I want to use the PS5 for its graphics. The visual impact alone is worth it.
