# 1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?

wire framing has 3 main concepts to develop the overall build process of a website or app. The three concepts are: User focuse, clarify and define website features, and they are quick and easy to make.

# 2.What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Low-fidelity frames: Basic and are a designers starting point. Useful to get a rough idea for both the user and the developer to get an idea of where the project is starting at and going to.

Mid-fidelity frames: Higher detailed outlines that are usually built digitally. The purpose of this is to get a more solid idea of layout/functionality of the app.

High-fidelity frames: Very specific layout details that are much closer to the finished product. Useful for exploring the functinality of the product without actually creating the finished product. Its still a presentation for getting the job.

# 3.Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I would be on the fence- I feel its an industry standard, but at the same time functonality can be created in Power Point. Power point has a greater field of scope including presentations, videos, and is a very powerful tool when learned. It is also an industry standard though not as fancy as figma or other "developer" tools its functionality is like a hammer. Its a key tool in any tool box that is not hard to learn.
