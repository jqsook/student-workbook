# This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like.

WK1 Reflection
Id like to start by saying that Im struggling. I have a basic background in code and really enjoy coding. Its the challenge and completion.

The first would be a change in mentality for me. We live in a click, drag, drop world that has added convinience in every way to our lives. This was the first hurdle for day 1. I try to run everything on the computer without the terminal so I set up VS code with things like live studio and the icon in the tab for easy use. I feel that is probably a barrier to entry for most coding courses. Im lazy and like the click drag drop life so Ill continue the simplicity of it.

Full stack web development. Its interesting because I like to code and would like to add more languages to my knowledge.

In summary the only question I have for myself is would I try as hard if I knew it didnt matter that I failed. I appreciate the opportunity to try.

GITHUB
This is the start of the challenge
NO GIT LINK FOR THIS
