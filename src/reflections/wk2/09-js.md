# What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

The development of a functional adaptable plan will save time in both the long and short term by keeping a coder focused on the project. If a coder is constantly jumping around without direction, its easy to get lost and forget where you were at. This could cause conflicts in the code between batches of code that arent in the flow.

# How do you find answers when you are stuck?

Google first- ask it the question you are having and see if there is an emerging pattern or a snippet of code that keeps popping up- in that is usually the key, but if nothing can be found, Youtube and ask a generic question that is similiar to the issue and see if something isnt kind of close that may give an idea of where to go from that point.

# From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

The running theme in code is concise, simple, easily readable, and easily changeable code. A system in place to maintain without having to hop back into the code to rebuild a section. Reduce time through implementing good thought before the project, both now and in the future.
