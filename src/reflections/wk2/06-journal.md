# What is Scope ?

Scope is the accessiblity of a an item (var etc.) in code. An example of this is the idea that you can declare a variable and make it 'Globally' accessiable, access that variable in a function anywhere in the code. A local variable is one defined inside of a container (like a function) and can only be acessed inside that function. It will cause errors if you try and access it inside the function.

# What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting- A languages behavior for moving a declaration () to the top of the code language. In other words you can declare a variable at the bottom of the code and it will find it, and make it usable at any point in the scope (with respect to scope)

# In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

let and var are redifinable
const is a fixed value so once you set it, to change it, you will have to find the origianal decleration.
