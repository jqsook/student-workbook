# What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

Through the developer tool- The sources and Network tabs.

Sources- Allows you change html/css elements.
Networks - allows you to see the network behind UI

# Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

Sources- It allows you to changes the html/css and see the impact of the change (real time) without changing the code in your VS ide. It also shows you via the box model what sizes and shapes look like so you can see if you have an issue casused by sizing or placement.

# Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Use the errors tab and narrow drill down to the source. Start at the top of the issues (or functions top to bottom) you are having and move from there.
