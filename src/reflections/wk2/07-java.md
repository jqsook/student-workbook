# What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

Syntactically- being able to write a complex, concise, and functional code that is written in the fewest amount of words/lines
three ways- Declaration, expression, and generator function.
each one uses fewer and fewer words to execute. Expression will not let you hoist and in some cases will only run once, generator can stop mid work and return to the same spot later on to finish the operation.

# What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameter is a variable used inside the function and an argument is the return of param+funct.

# What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

Higher order functions- functions that either take in other functions to process or output other functions. A function that takes or makes other functions.
