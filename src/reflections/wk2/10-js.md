Weekly Reflections
I think I like actual coding more than I like HTML/CSS. I understand Im putting content on together, but I am struggling with d-flex, flex-column, justify-content, and align-content.  
I think the JS side is more interesting and look forward to more advanced programming.

I think a good path for me would be
HTML/CSS -> python -> c#/C++, Unreal engine and Xcode

Challenges I could do along the way
HTML
WEbsite with the cool dayly challenges

Python
Ascii maze runner
Webscraper

C#/C++
Unreal engine products
I will do more reserch on the direction this could go

Xcode
App devolpment
Firebase API

I think this would be an interesting line for exploration as I continue on.

Resume Projects I would like to complete
Web crawler in python
App in Xcode
FPS- futurama game (1-2 levels)- based on the episode where zoidburgs people invade earth- play as fry and the only weapon available is the flame thrower. Steamed lobster.
