# Read Asynchronous Code > Async and Await and answer the following questions

# What is the purpose of Async/Await?

Reduce the amount of code surronding the promises and wont break the chain of promises

# What must you do in order to await a promise inside of a function?

Prepen await until the function is resolved.

# What are some of the primary benefits of Async/Await?

Code that is easier to read and it should be written as non-blocking, and its easier to debug- That would probably tie in with the easier to read also as its doesnt hit you with 10,000 lines of code to sort through.
