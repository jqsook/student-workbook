Signs: A large pyramid shape with the bottom being all } and ). Its written a visual top down way.

# What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

# Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix Callback Hell

Shallow code- break the code down from alot of script all together, to calling functions that work together to complete the same task.
