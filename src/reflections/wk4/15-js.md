# Read Asynchronous Code > JavaScript Promises and answer the following questions

# What are the three states of a Promise?

Pending, Resolved, and Rejected

# How do promises seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

It happens when a developer writes code in a pattern that is not in a javascript execution function. Python (ex.) uses a top down approach to code, while javascript will work in an asynchronous fashion.
It can be minimized by the use of modules and breaking bigger projects into smaller functions that can be called in-line.

# What is the difference between .then() and .catch()?

.then is for resolved promises and .catch is for failed promises
