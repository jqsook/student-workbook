# Read Advancing with JS > Encapsulation in JavaScript and answer the following questions

# What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is bundling of data and methods, such that access to the data is protected from external sources.

# What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

Breaking changes- internal methods and properties tend to change frequently- and without a standardized way of writing the private/internal properties it leaves the syntax open to interpretion by the developer.
This causes other issues with standardization meaning if a coder takes apart something and doesnt rewrite it exactly as it was, the code will break.
Hackers can exploit the issues with this external(public) vs internal (private) operations.

# How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

Enclosing them in a closure. Data privacy that will still be able to access its surrounding environement, but still offer the security necessary to prevent tampering.
